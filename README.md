# Softuni-Programming-Fundamentals
Containing the tasks from Softuni's course Programming Fundamentals.

The repository was recreated on Jan 27th 2017 in order to include the whole projects and not the .cs files only. Also .gitignore file was added.

The “Programming Fundamentals” course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the “Programming Basics” course at the Software University and adds additional knowledge and practical programming skills.

The course covers:

- source control systems, Git and GitHub for team collaboration;
- understanding the basic data types in programming;
- extracting pieces of code into methods with parameters and return values;
- using the debugger to trace the program execution and find bugs;
- processing sequences of elements using arrays and lists;
- working with matrices for processing tabular data;
- working with dictionaries to map keys to values;
- using strings for text processing;
- using Regular Expressions;
- basics of working with classes and objects, using API classes and defining simple classes;
